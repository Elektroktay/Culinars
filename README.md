As the Culinars team, we aim to enrich the cooking experience of users by making cooking entertaining, social, instructive, and faster than ever. 

**Culinars is a community platform for people to cook together, trade ingredients, share and discover recipes based on tastes, skill level, diets, allergies, and ingredients.**

Whether an easy and quick pasta, a delicious pizza, or an impressive shrimp recipe, Culinars connects people to unique cooking experiences at any skill level. â€‹With a growing community of users, Culinars also provides an easy way for people to monetize their extra ingredients and recipes by showcasing it to an audience of millions.

##How does it work?
By studying individual's and their friends' cuisine preferences, age, location, and dietary options, Culinars predicts tastes of its users and creates unique personalized recipe recommendations from the pool of user generated recipes. Then based on available ingredients, diets, allergies and skill levels of users, Culinars orders these recommendations dynamically.

By using the market platform users can monetize their extra ingredients or compensate their ingredient demands.

Despite traditional recipe apps, Culinars is more focused on the social side of cooking. Users can subscribe and create channels to upload, view, rate, share, comment on recipes. Based on the popularity and number of recipes submitted, Culinars rewards its users with coupons, discounts, invitations, and cash. To nourish inspiration and creativity, Culinars allow its users to share and view ingredients they have, recipe playlists, and what they are cooking at that moment,  while promoting to cook together through the invitation system. 

##Technology
The app uses mostly native libraries to achieve its look and feel. For the backend, Google's Firebase is used to store the data a fast & responsive realtime database, and have a secure authencation system to protect the users' data.
